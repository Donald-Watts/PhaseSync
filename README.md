ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Don Watts
I'm a small business owner, tech innovator, and founder of ADLS Consulting.

ðŸ”§ Currently building:
PhaseSync â€“ A developer tool to compress, weight, and auto-organize large-scale AI systems, making intelligent orchestration possible in any IDE. Available as a CLI utility and Cursor-compatible plugin.

ðŸ’¡ I believe in making powerful tools simple, and giving developers â€” and non-developers â€” the ability to build scalable, intelligent systems without being overwhelmed by code.
