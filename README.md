# PhaseSync
PhaseSync CLI &amp; Plugin Tool – Built to help developers and non-coders orchestrate intelligent AI systems.
👋 Hi, I'm Don Watts
I'm a small business owner, tech innovator, and founder of ADLS Consulting.

🔧 Currently building:
PhaseSync – A developer tool to compress, weight, and auto-organize large-scale AI systems, making intelligent orchestration possible in any IDE. Available as a CLI utility and Cursor-compatible plugin.                   
 Features:
* Symbolic Weight Analysis for project phases
* Lightweight compression using alphabetic numerics (A=1 to Z=26)
* Auto-sums and phase-based scoring
* Highlights critical files and design sequences
* CLI compatibility with Python backend
* Seamlessly integrates with Cursor IDE

💡 I believe in making powerful tools simple, and giving developers — and non-developers — the ability to build scalable, intelligent systems without being overwhelmed by code.
