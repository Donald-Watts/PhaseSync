Hello, I'm working on phasesync as you can see, this is a very complex tool that will make our lives easier. I'll release the cursor extension separately, I'm projecting.
I use as this a legacy code base and will build entirely new repositories where necessary the core logic is working there are some adaptations that are necessary, your welcome to look over the project and contribute.
I'll keep you up to date.
Thank you ADLS
