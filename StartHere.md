Hello, I'm working on phasesync as you can see, this is a tool that will make our lives easier. The release is in the master branch that is a solid state of all folders further packaging will happen soon. 
Since your here you can take a look around at the code and gain insight on some directions or ideas.  
Core logic is working, there are some adaptations that are necessary, your welcome to look over the project and contribute.
I'll keep you up to date.
Thank you ADLS
