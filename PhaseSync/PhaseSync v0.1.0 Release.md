# PhaseSync v0.1.0 Release

## Overview
PhaseSync is a groundbreaking semantic compression tool that revolutionizes how we track and manage development phases. By implementing the Symbolic Weight Protocol (SWP), it bridges the gap between semantic understanding and symbolic representation, making phase management more efficient and AI-friendly.

## Key Features

### 1. Semantic Compression
- Converts development phases into single-digit weights while preserving meaning
- Implements letter-to-number mapping (A=1 to Z=26)
- Reduces complex phase descriptions to manageable symbolic weights
- Maintains semantic relationships between phases

### 2. Phase Management
- Standardized phase identification across projects
- Seven core development phases with consistent weights
- Phase tagging system (@phase, @task, @weight)
- Bidirectional phase/weight lookup

### 3. Visualization Tools
- Step-by-step compression visualization
- Phase weight reporting
- Interactive phase analysis
- Custom visualization exports

### 4. Developer Tools
- Command-line interface for quick operations
- Python API for programmatic access
- Comprehensive test suite
- Type hints and documentation

## Technical Highlights

### Core Components
- Symbol Compressor: Implements SWP algorithm
- Symbol Map: JSON-based phase-to-weight mappings
- Visualizer: Analysis and display tools
- CLI: Command-line interface

### Development Phases
1. Foundation and Definition (8)
2. Blueprint and Canonical Structure (2)
3. Scaffolding and Schema Definition (6)
4. Core Feature Development (8)
5. Intelligence Learning Test Suites (7)
6. User Interface and Orchestration (9)
7. Finalization and Product (8)

### System Requirements
