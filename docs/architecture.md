## System Architecture Placeholder 

## Overview

PhaseSync is designed as a dual-build system to manage and organize large codebases using the Symbolic Weight Protocol (SWP). The architecture separates concerns between a Python-based SWP engine and a TypeScript-based IDE extension, connected via a robust interface layer.

### Core Components

- **SWP Engine (Python):**
  - Implements the Symbolic Weight Protocol (SWP) for text compression and weight analysis.
  - Provides CLI and RPC interfaces for integration.
- **IDE Extension (TypeScript/Node.js):**
  - Integrates with Cursor IDE and VS Code.
  - Provides commands, UI, and automation for developers.
- **Interface Layer:**
  - **CLI:** Command-line interface for direct engine access.
  - **Bridge:** Node.js â†” Python communication (e.g., python-shell).
  - **RPC:** Remote procedure calls for advanced integration.

### Component Relationships

- The IDE Extension communicates with the SWP Engine via the Interface Layer.
- The Bridge and RPC components handle all data exchange and error handling between the extension and the engine.
- The CLI allows for standalone use of the SWP Engine.

### Diagram Reference

See `component-diagram.json` for a visual representation of the system's components and their relationships.



## Next Steps

- Define each component in detail.
- Document data flow in `data-flow.md`.
- Keep this document updated as the architecture evolves.
